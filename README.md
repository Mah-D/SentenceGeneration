SentenceGeneration
==================
While ago we were interested in generating random [PEG] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)sentences. This made us to try few experiments on CFG sentence generation too. 
[randomStringGen.js] (https://github.com/Mah-D/SentenceGeneration/blob/master/randomStringGen.js)is a tiny library that receives a CFG grammar and the _start_ state, and generates random sentences. Look [main.js] (https://github.com/Mah-D/SentenceGeneration/blob/master/main.js) to see how to use it.
